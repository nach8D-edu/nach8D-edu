## 🎮 Game industry veteran turned Computer Science teacher 👨‍🏫
After years crafting worlds and systems at top gaming companies, I've jumped into a new kind of adventure: teaching the next generation of developers.
Now I'm sharing code, tools, and little sparks of what I’ve learned — all from my journey through the world of game dev to the classroom.

🚀 Passionate about technology, clean code, and tackling complex programming challenges. I enjoy building applications that demand high scalability and concurrency. I’m also driven by helping students grow from "Hello World" to real-world projects.

🎓 Currently teaching in the Grado Superior - Desarrollo de Aplicaciones Multiplatadorma and loving every minute of it.

💬 I'm always open to meaningful collaborations in the field of education — whether it's sharing ideas, building something useful, or just geeking out about teaching tech.

🙌 Feedback on the code I share here is always welcome — learning is a two-way street!
